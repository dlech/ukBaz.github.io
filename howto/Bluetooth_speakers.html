    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <P>
        I often want to look at using my Raspberry Pi with Bluetooth audio. I normally run my RPi without a desktop
        environment so those graphical tools aren't available to me easily. This got me wondering if I could do Bluetooth
        audio from the commandline. I have started to some investigation into how this works. This HowTo is me capturing
        my notes as I go and will hopefully be improved over time and maybe even extend to doing it with Python.
    </P>
    <p>
        This is done with the Bluetooth Advance Audio Distribution Profile (A2DP) which has a Source and Sink option.

    </p>

<h2>Understanding UUID's</h2>
    <p>
        Bluetooth profiles and services are referred to by Universally Unique Identifier (UUID).
        These take the form of 128-bit hexadecimal numbers and normally formated as sequence of 32 hex digits grouped
        in groups of 8-4-4-4-12 e.g. 00000000-0000-1000-8000-00805F9B34FB<br>
        This can be rather cumbersome when documenting things so for officially adopted UUID's they can be
        documented is a short form (or 16-bit UUIDs). <br>
        The 16-bit UUID is placed with the base 128-bit UUID 0000xxxx-0000-1000-8000-00805F9B34FB<br>
        In this HowTo you will see UUIDs in both their 128-bit and 16-bit form.
    </p>
    <p>
        As a side note, this means if you are creating your own services or characteristics the you should avoid the reserved range of
        xxxxxxxx-0000-1000-8000-00805F9B34FB but I digress...
    </p>

<h2>Sending Audio (Audio Source - 0x110A)</h2>
<p>
    The first experiment I did was to use a Raspberry Pi 3 as a source connecting to a Jabra Solemate Bluetooth speaker.

<p>
    Now we have paired and said that we trust the device, just turning on the Bluetooth
    speaker automatically connects to the Raspberry Pi.
</p>
<p>
    To access the audio device we need to put the details in a file called ".asoundrc" in
your home directory. e.g. ~/.asoundrc<br>
More documentation at: <a href="https://www.alsa-project.org/main/index.php/Asoundrc">https://www.alsa-project.org/main/index.php/Asoundrc</a><br>
For this example the details are:

</p>
<pre>
    defaults.bluealsa.interface "hci0"
    defaults.bluealsa.device "50:C9:71:67:41:CD"
    defaults.bluealsa.profile "a2dp"
    defaults.bluealsa.delay 10000

</pre>
<p>
    We can play a sound over Bluetooth from the commandline with:
</p>
<pre>
    aplay -D bluealsa /usr/share/scratch/Media/Sounds/Animal/Crickets.wav
</pre>

<h2>Receiving Audio (Audio Sink - 0x110B)</h2>
<p>
    The second experiment I did was to use a Raspberry Pi 3 as a Bluetooth speaker. For this I connected a normal speaker
    to the 3.5mm audio connector and used an Android phone as the audio source.

<p>
    Next the Bluetooth audio-in needs to be routed to the speaker that is attached. This can be done with the following
    command:
</p>
<pre>
    bluealsa-aplay 64:BC:0C:F6:22:F8
</pre>
<p>
    The results of this were... disappointing. The audio was cutting out very frequently. A little bit of research shows
    this is a know issue which you can find more out about at:<br>
    <a href="https://github.com/Arkq/bluez-alsa/issues/60">https://github.com/Arkq/bluez-alsa/issues/60</a><br>
    <a href="https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux/issues/1552">https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux/issues/1552</a><br>
</p>
<p>
    For those that don't want to read the long issues on this the summary seems to be
<blockquote>
    it is a problem with Raspberry Pi firmware. Wifi and BT do not coexist very well
</blockquote>
</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
    This was not the exciting result I had hoped for coming into this. Time to park this for a while and see if it gets
    sorted out in the mean time...
