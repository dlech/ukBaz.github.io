    <title>Scanning for Beacons on the Linux command line</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Scanning for Bluetooth Beacons on the Linux command line</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
    Small Single Board Computers (SBC) such as Raspberry Pi 3 (RPi3) with their built in BLE 4.0 controllers are enough
    to scan for Bluetooth Low Energy beacons such as those that use the <a href="https://github.com/google/eddystone">
    Eddystone format</a> beacons.
</p>>
<p>
    The BlueZ maintainers however are not so keen on supporting scanning for beacons with their command=line tools
    as there is a concern that such activity is quite resource intensive.
</p>
<p>
    Many tutorials on the internet are done with command-line tools with the now deprecated tools of
    hcitool and hcidump. This 'HowTo' looks at how to scan for beacons without using those tools.
</p>

<h2>Scanning for Beacons</h2>
<p>
    The go-to tool when using Bluetooth from the Linux command-line is <code>bluetoothctl</code>.
</p>
<p>
    In a  terminal use the BlueZ command-line tool to put the RPi3 into scanning mode by issuing the `scan on` command.
    It is also a good idea to clear all filtering options. My session looked like this:
</p>
<pre>
    pi@RPi3:~ $ <mark>bluetoothctl</mark>
    [bluetooth]# <mark>set-scan-filter-clear</mark>
    SetDiscoveryFilter success
    [bluetooth]# <mark>scan on</mark>

    [bluetooth]# <mark>scan off</mark>

</pre>
<p>
    The 16-bit UUID for the <a href="https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/assigned-numbers/16-bit-uuids-for-members?_ga=2.105995968.2115520943.1514979233-967253953.1449700706"> Eddystone Service </a>
    is 0xfeaa.
</p>
<p>
    Once we know the Service UUID we can filter to see just Eddystone beacons in bluetoothctl. For example:
</p>
<pre>
    [bluetooth]# <mark>set-scan-filter-uuids 0xfeaa</mark>
    SetDiscoveryFilter success
    [bluetooth]# <mark>scan on</mark>

<p>
    In this example it has not made any difference. However, if you have other Bluetooth devices advertising
    nearby it will be very helpful to reduce how much is reported.
</p>
<h2>Detailed Reporting of Bluetooth Activity</h2>
<p>
    To view <em>all</em> the activity on the RPi's Bluetooth controller there is a Bluetooth monitoring tool from
    BlueZ called "btmon".
    This has a very verbose output as it does tell us <em>everything</em> that is happening with the
    Bluetooth controller and is typically used for debugging low-level issues.
</p>
<p>
    To run btmon in a terminal use the following command:
<pre>sudo btmon</pre>
</p>
<p>
    With bluetoothctl scanning in the first terminal, btmon will report such things as an "LE Advertising Report"
    which will contain information about nearby devices that are advertising. Our beacon should be in amongst all the
    output in btmon. For example:
</p>
<p>
<pre>
    > HCI Event: LE Meta Event (0x3e) plen 41                    [hci0] 1316.838336
          LE Advertising Report (0x02)
            Num reports: 1
            Event type: Non connectable undirected - ADV_NONCONN_IND (0x03)
            Address type: Random (0x01)
            Address: F1:55:90:65:29:DC (Static)
            Data length: 29
            Flags: 0x06
              LE General Discoverable Mode
              BR/EDR Not Supported
            16-bit Service UUIDs (complete): 1 entry
              Google (0xfeaa)
            Service Data (UUID 0xfeaa): 00f600000000000000000021000000000009
            RSSI: -55 dBm (0xc9)
</pre>

</p>

<h2>Duplicates</h2>
<p>
    Beacons are broadcasting/advertising very frequently (every second or so) and you will notice that the BlueZ tools
    are not reporting all occurrences of those adverts. This is because the BlueZ tools are filtering duplicate
    adverts. This is done because of concerns about the machine resources being consumed in doing such activity.
</p>
<p>
    The BlueZ project has deprecated the command-line tool <code>hcitool</code> that did allow this. This is because
    the tool used the <code>Host Controller Interface</code> (HCI) which is a very low-level interface and did not protect
    the user from being able to do very bad things to their system. The new BlueZ tools give the user more protection
    however it does mean the tools do not report duplicates.
</p>
    If you still have hcitool on your system then you can see every
    broadcast from your beacon show up in <code>btmon</code> using the following command:
<pre>
    sudo hcitool lescan --duplicates
</pre>


<p>
    Some of the Bluetooth libraries that act as scanners can read all beacon broadcasts. <br>
    One of the best Python libraries I've found for scanning for beacons is <a href="https://github.com/frawau/aioblescan">aioblescan</a>.
</p>
<h2>Other Beacon Types</h2>
<p>
    Much of what is described above should work for any BLE beacons. I've focused on Eddystone as it is an open
    specification and most widely supported. One interesting place that has Eddystone support is the
    <a href="https://makecode.microbit.org/reference/bluetooth">MakeCode</a> editor for micro:bit
    which supports very easy access to programming Eddystone beacons.
</p>
<p>
    Jos Ryke (<a href="https://twitter.com/josryke">@josryke</a>) has posted on Twitter a great summary on how the
    packets vary between the different beacon types.
</p>

    <p align=center><img width="90%" alt="Beacon Packet Summary" src="../asset/beacon_packet_cheatsheet.jpg"></p>
<p>
    With the aid of Jos's diagram and the <a href="https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/assigned-numbers/generic-access-profile">
    Generic Access Profile</a> specification we can see that Eddystone adverts have a type of <code>03</code>
    (Complete List of 16-bit Service Class UUIDs) where as ibeacon has a type of <code>FF</code>
    (Manufacturer Specific Data).
</p>
<p>
    This means data being broadcast is reported slightly differently. For example, for ibeacon the Major and Minor
    values are Manufacturer Data while for Eddystone UID Namespace and Instance values are Service Data.
</p>
<p>
    In bluetoothctl this presents itself as the following:<br>
    For ibeacon:
    <pre>
    [CHG] Device 56:9E:9F:3D:3A:EB ManufacturerData Key: 0x004c
    [CHG] Device 56:9E:9F:3D:3A:EB ManufacturerData Value: 0x10
    [CHG] Device 56:9E:9F:3D:3A:EB ManufacturerData Value: 0x05
    [CHG] Device 56:9E:9F:3D:3A:EB ManufacturerData Value: 0x0b
    [CHG] Device 56:9E:9F:3D:3A:EB ManufacturerData Value: 0x10
    [CHG] Device 56:9E:9F:3D:3A:EB ManufacturerData Value: 0x88
    [CHG] Device 56:9E:9F:3D:3A:EB ManufacturerData Value: 0xed
    [CHG] Device 56:9E:9F:3D:3A:EB ManufacturerData Value: 0x6e
    [CHG] Device 56:9E:9F:3D:3A:EB RSSI: -80
</pre>
And for Eddystone UID:

<p>By looking at the list <a href="https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/assigned-numbers/company-identifiers">Company Identifiers</a> we can learn that the <i>ManufacturerData Key</i> of 0x004c is for Apple.</p>
