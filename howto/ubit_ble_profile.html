    <title>ubit BLE Pin Service</title>

<p>
<h1>Getting Started with the micro:bit IO Pin Service</h1>

<p> The intention of the <a href="https://github.com/ukBaz/python-bluezero">Bluezero</a> library is that it will allow
    people to interact with over Bluetooth without necessarily
knowing too much about the low-level details. However, I also want people to be able to learn more about Bluetooth. </p>

<p>What I wanted to capture in this post was  the process I went through to understand the IO Pin Service from the
    <a href="https://lancaster-university.github.io/microbit-docs/resources/bluetooth/bluetooth_profile.html">micro:bit BLE Profile</a>
    when I was implementing this is Bluezero.</p>

<p>The most difficult pieces for me to get my head around were:
    <ul>
    <li>the Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) output </li>
    <li>change pins to be digital or analogue inputs </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p> The first thing needed is some way of sending the low-level commands to the micro:bit.<br>
    Below are some details of the apps I used and how I broke the problem up.

</p>

<h2>BLE Apps:</h2>
<p>Before I start to add functionality to the Bluezero library I like to test my understanding of the
    service/characteristics with as direct a method as possible.
    This means working out what hexadecimal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octet_(computing)">octets</a> need to be sent.
Doing this type of work normally means using the
    <a href="https://www.nordicsemi.com/eng/Products/Nordic-mobile-Apps/nRF-Connect-for-mobile-previously-called-nRF-Master-Control-Panel">nRF Connect app</a>
    from Nordic Semiconductor on a mobile platform. If you are going to be experimenting with BLE and you only want one
    app, then this is the one to have.</p>
<p>For Linux and Chromebook it is bluetoothctl that I use for this testing.
    bluetoothctl is really helpful both for testing what data is sent and received. On Linux it is also useful to have
    it running in a different shell when I’m testing Bluezero to see messages from the Bluetooth daemon.<br>
    One of the problems with bluetoothctl is that there isn’t lots of internet resources you can refer to about it.<br>
    Apart from typing ‘bluetoothctl’ and then typing ‘help’ to get a list of the commands, you need to work things
    out for yourself which isn't always easy the first time.</p>
<p>On the Mac I've found
    <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/lightblue/id639944780?mt=12">Lightblue</a> to be the best although it isn't
    great and I tend not to use it as often as the others.
</p>

<h2>PWM Output:</h2>
<p>Right, back to those pesky characteristics. Let’s start with the PWM output [UUID: E95DD822-251D-470A-A062-FA1922DFA9A8]
    characteristic. It is made up of seven
    octets to define three numbers which are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Pin number (1 octet)</li>
    <li>Value is in the range 0 – 1023 (2 octets)</li>
    <li>Period is the duration of time of one cycle in milliseconds (4 octets)</li>
</ul>
<p>The final thing we need to be aware of is that fields are transmitted over the air in Little Endian format.</p>

<p>Let’s start with the easy one, the pin number. Take the pin number e.g. 0 and convert it to hexadecimal octet 0x00.<br>
    OK, not a great example, let’s try 12 & 19. They would be 0x0C and 0x13 in hexadecimal.
</p>
<p>For the value, let’s take four values and convert them into hexadecimal.<br>
256, 512, 768, 1023 become the following in hexadecimal occupying two octets 0x0100, 0x0200, 0x0300 & 0x03FF. </p>

<p>However that isn’t the value we need to send as they are not in the little endian format.
    This means that the four values we send are 0x0001, 0x0002, 0x0003 & 0xFF03.</p>
<p>My experiments were to activate the buzzer on the
    <a href="https://www.kitronik.co.uk/5610-mipower-board-for-the-bbc-microbit.html">MI:power board</a>
   so I choose the note that is the 49th key from a piano which is 440 Hz and the frequency I wanted to send.</p>
<p>This frequency has a period of roughly 2273 microseconds which as a 4 octet hexadecimal would be 0x000008E1.<br>
    We need to change this to little endian so it becomes 0xE1080000.</p>
<p>
Now we have worked out how to handle each of the values let’s put it together.<br>
    If we wanted to set pin 0 to a value of 512 with a period of 2273 we would send  0x00 0002 E1080000.</p>
<p>In the nRF Connect app this would look like:
</p>
    <img src="../asset/send_value.png" alt="nRF Connect App send value" >

<p>When the send button was pressed this created a suitably annoying beep on the the MI:power board</p>
<p>To stop the beep we can just send 14 zeros.</p>

<p>After my experiments I summarised my experiments with the IO outputs with a cheat sheet for future reference:</p>

<h2>Changing direction and type of Pins</h2>
<p>
    With the outputs taken care of, it was time to move on to understanding inputs.
</p>
<p>
    There are two characteristics that control if pins are input/output and analogue/digital. Depending how these are
    set will change the behaviour of pin data.
</p>
<h3>Reading Digital Values:</h3>
<p>To read the value of a pin, the Pin IO Configuration [UUID: E95DB9FE-251D-470A-A062-FA1922DFA9A8] needs to be changed.</p>
<p>
    This characteristic is 32 bits (4 octets) where the 20 least significant bits represent the 20 pins. <br>
    If we set a bit to 0 it represents an output while a 1 represents an input.
</p>
<p>
    If we want to set Pin 0 as an input we would need to set the bit to 1.<br>
    This would make the hexadecimal value as 0x00000001. <br>
    So again, as the data needs to be little endian we would need to send this as 0x01000000.
</p>

<h3>Reading Analogue Values:</h3>
<p>The Pin AD Configuration is again a characteristic of 32 bits (4 octets) the same as the Pin IO Configuration
    [UUID: E95D5899-251D-470A-A062-FA1922DFA9A8] but this time a 0 represents a digital pin and 1 represents analogue.
</p>
<p>
    To read an analogue value on a pin we need set it as an input and analogue.<br>
    For example pin 2 would require 0x04000000 to be sent to both the Pin IO Configuration and Pin AD Configuration.
</p>
<h3>Getting the value</h3>
<p>Now the pin is configured as an input, this means when we read the Pin Data
    [UUID: E95DB9FE-251D-470A-A062-FA1922DFA9A8] characteristic we will see pairs of octets return that represent the
    pin and value. For example if pin 5 is a digital input with a high on it then the hexidecimal that would be returned
would be: <i>0501</i>. <br>
    0x05 is the pin and 0x01 represents a high.
</p>
<p>
    It is similar for the analogue input in that there is still a pin/value pair but the value can be higher than 1.
    It can be in the range of 0 to 255 (0xFF).
    For example pin 2 at half value would return <i>0280</i><br>
    0x05 is the pin and 0x80 is a value of 128 in decimal.
