<h2>Overview</h2>
<P>
    I have been experimenting with creating a <a href="microbit_touch.html" target="_blank">'home made' capacitive touch sensor</a>
    for the micro:bit. During those experiments it became clear that I needed some way of accurately data logging
    the performance of different designs.
</P>
<p>
    This is when I started to look around for a solution and took a look at the
    <a href="http://www.bittysoftware.com/apps/bitty_data_logger.html">bitty data logger</a>.
    It is a paid for app and at £1.99 it is not the cheapest however it did seem to do exactly what I was looking for.
    It was reassuring to see that it had good documentation and I had also seen positive feedback about it on Twitter
    so I took the plunge.
</p>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>
    Bitty Software have done a <a href="http://www.bittysoftware.com/tutorials.html#data_logger">tutorial</a>
    for C++ and for MakeCode. It was using the MakeCode editor that I was
    interested in using so that is where I started.
</p>
<p>
    I had the app reporting my sensor values in no time so it must be a good tutorial!
</p>
<h2>Pins or Channels</h2>
<p>
    The tutorial talks about sending the "pin number and analog value read from that pin" and that worked well.
    However after using the app for a while I thought that it would help me more if  I could  send the
    calibrated reference value of the sensor as well as the
    ongoing averaged value. This is when I realised that I could send the data I required by thinking of the apps
    functionality as selecting channels of data rather than pins.
</p>
<h2>Transmitting Data</h2>
<p align="center">
    <img width="90%" alt="transmit sensor data function" src="../asset/bitty_logger/transmit_data.png">
</p>
<p>
    The data that is displayed in the bitty data logger on the phone is sent to it by raising a <code>9030</code> event.<br>
    The value of the event has the reading that you want charting plus the pin number.
</p>
<p>
    In my code I am sending:
<ul>
    <li><code>calibrationValue + THRESHOLD</code> to be displayed as pin 0</li>
    <li><code>reading ÷ SAMPLES + 16384</code> to be displayed as pin 1</li>
</ul>
In the next section I will explain why I added the magic number of <code>16384</code>
to the reading is tell the app that the data is for Pin 1.
</p>
<h2>Bitwise Operations</h2>
<p>
    <img width="90%" alt="Binary Data Structure" src="../asset/bitty_logger/bit_data.png">
</p>
<p>
    The app uses 16-bits to send the data from the micro:bit to the app. Of those 16-bits, it expects 2-bits for
    the pin (or channel in my terminology) and 12-bits for the value to be displayed.<br>
    In the Bitty tutorial they do things properly and use bitwise operations to move the pin number along 14-bits
    so the bits for the pin number take their rightful place in the data sent to the app.
</p>
<p>
    By default I can not see that the MakeCode editor supports bitwise operations in the block editor. I worked
    around this by using the diagram above to see where the pin values should be in the data and calculate
    the denary values for the pins:

<ul>
    <li>For pin 1 the binary is <code>01</code> and when in bit location 15 & 14 the denary value is 16384.</li>
    <li>For pin 2 the binary is <code>10</code> and when in bit location 15 & 14 the denary value is 32768.</li>
    <li>For pin 0 the binary is <code>00</code> and when in bit location 15 & 14 the denary value is 0.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>

</p>
<p>
    Being able to get charts like this in real time as I tweaked the design of the
    <a href="microbit_touch.html" target="_blank">'home made' capacitive touch sensor</a> has been such a help
    I think the £1.99 was money well spent.
